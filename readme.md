The purpose of this map is to show the Average student debt per borrower in the Unites States in 2022. The data was collected from the Education Data Initiative article titled "Student Loan By State" A yellow to green color palette was chosen for this map to differentiate between higher and lower amounts of student loan debt. A dark green represents a higher value of average student loans, while a light yellow represents a smaller number of average student loans. The map contains many different interactive elements such as a hover feature that tells you the exact amount of loans, as well as a zoom feature that will zoom the viewer into the state upon clicking. The map also includes a description, title, and legend for the viewer.
